<!--Introduction text-->
<div class ="introtext">
<p> In 1999, two young men killed 12 students and wounded 24 others at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. The incident sparked a long series of school shootings in the United States that has continues to this day. Not a single year has passed since 1999 without at least five school shootings in the U.S. There have been at least 214 school shootings since Columbine, according to newly released data by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/local/school-shootings-database/?utm_term=.2fd77db35d2c">The Washington Post</a> that examines school shootings at secondary and primary schools in the U.S since the Columbine shooting. </p>

</div>

<p>At least five school school shootings have occurred every year since 1999, with an average number of 11 shootings per-year.  2006 and 2014 had the highest number of incidents with fifteen and sixteen school shootings, respectively. As can be seen the chart below, the past three years have remained consistently high, with at least a dozen incidents each year.  </p>

 <!-- END first graphic container-->


<p> School shootings have occured all over the United States, as seen in the map below. In general, higher population areas have seen more incidents, with shootings clustered on the east and west coasts. California, which is the most populous state in the country, had 27 school shooting incidents since 1999, the most of any state. The next highest state was Florida with 16 school shootings since 1999. </p>
<br>


<p>An analysis of the data shows that cities with the most number of school shootings tend to be large urban areas with high crime rates. Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia top the list with five school shootings each. The data also reveals that the majority of shootings occur in places that would be considered “cities”, while just 14% occur in rural areas (see chart below).</p>

<p>Almost all school shootings occur at public schools. According to the data collected by the Washington Post, only 5% of school shootings since 1999 have occured at a private school.</p>

<img src="images/star-blue.png" class="star-top"> The carnage of school shootings </h2>
</div>

<p> 131 people have been killed in school shooting incidents in the United States since the Columbine massacre in 1999. The two deadliest years since have been 2012, when 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and 2018, when 21 people were killed at Parkland High School. The chart below compared the number of people killed, the number of the people injured and the number of incidents by year since 1999. </p>

<!-- line chart-->

<p>Most school shootings are targeted, seeking to harm a specific individual or group. Over 60% of shootings fall into this category, followed by indiscriminate shootings and accidental. See the chart below for more details. </p>
